# ToDo:

-   Thermal coupling between the manifold-channels and the bipolar-plate 
    should be added via an additional exchange term at channel inlets and 
    outlets and the corresponding temperature change in the manifolds
    
-   Calculation of mixture temperatures at channels outlets into the outlet
    manifolds should be integrated
 
-   Two-phase flow should be incorporated for porous media, channels and 
    manifolds and its influence on effective diffusion coefficients and 
    pressure drop in the channels
    
-   Quasi-3D-Discretization should be incorporated for differentiation between 
    channel and rib areas for the cell to increase accuracy for two-phase flow 
    simulations

-   Automatization algorithm to fit given polarization curves 
    using defined fitting-parameter should be implemented.
